        <h3>Hey there, I'm Arale â€“ welcome to SewDB! ðŸ§µâœ¨</h3>
        <p className="mainFont">
          This little corner of the internet is where I collect all my sewing
          patterns. Think of it as my personal sewing database, where patterns
          can be browsed, filtered, and liked. SewDB is mainly for my friendsâ€”so
          when they ask me to sew something, we can easily find the perfect
          pattern together. But honestly? This is more than just a collection.
          It's where my past career, my love for sewing, and my dream of working
          in tech come together. A little bit of code, a little bit of
          creativity, and a whole lot of passion stitched into one. To respect
          copyright rules, SewDB is a private space. You'll need to log in to
          access everything, but once you're in, feel free to explore and get
          inspired!
