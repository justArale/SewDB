# React/HONC SewDB

## Description

SewDB is a private, full-stack web application for managing and browsing sewing patterns. It was developed as a personal project to explore the HONC stack â€” a modern, serverless architecture combining Hono, Neon, and Drizzle â€” which I first encountered during a hackathon.

The platform allows authenticated users to view, search, and manage sewing patterns. Features include protected routes, user authentication (secure HTTP-only cookies), role-based access control, and a responsive image carousel. The application is built with TypeScript on both the frontend (React + Vite) and backend, and integrates services like Cloudinary for image handling.

SewDB serves as both a practical tool for organizing creative work and a demonstration of modern full-stack development practices using lightweight, scalable technologies.
